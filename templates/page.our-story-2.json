Why? Because even then, I loved chocolate with a passion that defied limits. Fast forward a few years, and 12-year-old me was sitting in a dentist’s chair, staring down six cavities after yet another chocolate binge. Clearly, my sweet tooth wasn’t going anywhere.<\/p>"}},"item_3rrXwL":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/EDITED-14096078.jpg","icon":"none","icon_width":48,"title":"Dreams Beyond Sweets","content":"<p>Around that same time, I fell in love with basketball.

First, I needed the best cacao in the world—something pure, rich, magical—cacao that embodies everything I’ve ever loved about the experience of chocolate. Then came the big question: what would I use to sweeten it? Being Middle Eastern, the answer was almost too obvious: Dates. Sweet, velvety, natural, and nutrient-packed, they were the perfect complement.<\/p>"}},"item_kdgMQi":{"type":"item","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/EDITED-2.jpg","icon":"none","icon_width":48,"title":"From the Kitchen to The Conscious Bar","content":"<p>With some help from a friend, armed with a countertop chocolate refiner I bought off Amazon for $250, I dove into my first batch.

So I kept pushing.<\/p><p>From there, the next move was obvious—I needed to find the manufacturer to get this recipe alive and kicking. After eight months of refining the recipe, I could finally say with confidence that we had created the absolute most delicious chocolate I’ve ever tasted.
